Faster R-CNN or YOLO
Collection of dataset
-Collect Raw datase
-Identify feature and label sources
-select a sampling strategy
For annotation and labelling you can use
-https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg
We need around 2000 images
Assuming augmentation gives around 10 images we still need around 10 images per class
22 different classes
tensorflow imagedatagenerator

Data augmentation
- You have to do it after test train split to avoid overfitting
- You can use ImageDatagenerator or any github library to do it e.g imgaug
-cv.imread() gives images in BGR format

My model will predict the item's Name
We will work on it's improvisations later
Like weight,flavor,exp.date and so

Idea 
- detect for presence of objects
-our model will learn that it is best to read names so don't worry about it

dataset
-Using developer tools in firefox
-simulating right click using javascript code
-simulate the context bar using the same code
-DOM (document object model)
-bubbling just like recursion
-dispatching event in the sense acting it upon the element

Important code details
-.strip() removes spaces at the start and end of the file

Don't use logo detection because the same logo can apply for different products
Also you need the product coordinates rather than the logo coordinates
